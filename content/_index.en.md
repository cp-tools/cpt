This project draws heavy inspiration from [xalanq/cf-tool](https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool) and [online-judge-tools/oj](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/oj) and combines the features of each, to provide an all rounded, command line tool for competitive programming.

This project is built using [GO](https://golang.org), making the tool lightweight, blazingly fast and dependency free (simply download the executable and run).
